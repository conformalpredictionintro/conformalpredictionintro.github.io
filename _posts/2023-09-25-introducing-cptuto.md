title: Introducing (another) Conformal Prediction tutorial!
---

On this website you can find [slides](link) of an introductive tutorial to Conformal Prediction, built during the PhD studies of [Margaux Zaffran](https://mzaffran.github.io/).  

Feel free to re-use and adapt the slides (tex sources and notebook to reproduce images are also available): if you do, please **refer to this page and license**.

- [tex sources](_includes/files/cptuto_sources.zip)
- [figures notebook](_includes/files/cptuto_notebook_images.ipynb)

***

The outline is the following:  
1. Quantile Regression  

1. Split Conformal Prediction
    - Standard mean-regression case
    - Conformalized Quantile Regression
    - Generalization of SCP: going beyond regression
1. Avoiding data splitting: full conformal and out-of-bags approaches
    - Full Conformal Prediction
    - Jackknife+ (and CV+)
1. Beyond exchangeability
